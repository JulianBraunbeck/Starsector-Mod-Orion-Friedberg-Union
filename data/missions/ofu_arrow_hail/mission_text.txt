Location: Magec System, some distance from Guayota's Disk

During the last two months tensions between the Persean League and the Union, caused by a Union merchant traveling from Kazeron in Hyperspace refusing to comply for an inspection and Persean League forces subsequantly carrying it out under the threat of their guns, have spiraled into harassment of merchant fleets, general raiding and armed skirmishes.

Commodore Michael Volta commanding the third Carrier group of the Union is en route to protect trade convoys in the Magec system from both League and Pirate raiders, when shortly before the midnight shift-change a Persean League Cruiser Squadron and several mercenary vessels emerge from Guayota's disk on a direct intercept course.

With too little time to evade the enemy squadron pursuing the precious carriers at full burn, Commodore Volta orders combat stations.
