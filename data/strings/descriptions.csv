ofu_flarelauncher_super,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches a powerful flare to distract missiles and fighters,Defensive,Launches a powerful flare to distract missiles and fighters,,
ofu_asbolus,SHIP,"The Asbolus class, integrating incomplete Pre-Collapse research on sensor miniaturization and advanced instrumentation, employs cutting-edge systems to accurately track targets at extraordinary ranges. This capability makes it ideal for system patrols, escort missions, and long-range support operations.

Developed during the AI War Interbellum, the Asbolus class exemplifies the technological resurgence of the Union worlds following the chaos of the preceding century.",,,,
ofu_frigate_1,SHIP,"Though somewhat lacking in firepower and defenses, the Argeus-class frigate is among the swiftest craft in the sector, able to scout and occupy tactical locations to great effect.

As a pre-collapse redesign of an obscure class of frigate, the Argeus class would likely never have seen deployment were it not for the dire post-collapse need for anything spaceworthy.",,,,
ofu_agamemnon,SHIP,"A defensive heavy cruiser, the Agamemnon class is capable of enduring considerable amounts of punishment thanks to a balance of strong shields and armor. It's inbuilt Gletscher artillery battery is excellent at providing long range suppressive fire while it's other weapon slots are generally filled with long to medium range options. 

Designed in the wake of the Champion affair, the Agamemnon was a centerpiece of a Pre-Collapse strategy shift by Orion Shipyards, which consisted of several entirely new ship classes. The blueprints arrived only shortly before the collaps, after Orion Shipyards selected it's Persean sector holdings to test the production of prototypes outside of it's most advanced facilities. These samples form the basis of the current day Union fleet program.",,,,
ofu_fr_missile,SHIP,"The Sithon class is capable of rapidly deploying its considerable missile payload in fearsome salvoes, enabling it to assume various strike roles. However, once it has expended it's missile payload it rarely presents a credible threat.

A recent Pre-Collapse design, the Sithon was the result of a hostile takeover of the relatively small Bergen Arms LLC by Orion shipyards. At the time, the project was derided by some as an oversized bomber with little use beyond short engagements.",,,,
ofu_bellerophon,SHIP,"The Bellerophon-class battlecarrier is a modular design capable of excelling in a wide range of scenarios. It pairs this versatility with respectable onboard firepower—enough to reinforce its wings or operate independently when needed.

This flexibility makes the Bellerophon something of a wildcard, a favorite among independent captains who value adaptability and unconventional tactics.",,,,
ofu_diomedes,SHIP,"The Diomedes class employs a rigorously tested and highly effective electronic warfare suite, specializing in fleet support and enemy disruption operations. Its advanced ECM capabilities provide a decisive edge in combat scenarios.

Favored by Union intelligence operatives, affluent mercenaries, and independent brokers, the Diomedes is highly regarded for its reliability and effectiveness.",,,,
ofu_telemachus,SHIP,"The Telemachus class is a mobile light cruiser built around a versatile missile armament and supporting ballistic weaponry paired with decent speed.

A Post-Collapse design built in the same spirit as the Sithon-class frigate, the Telemachus Class was designed with the unusual feature of turreted missile mounts. While a mechanical design challenge, it considerably improves the ease-of-use for torpedos, especially at close range.",,,,
ofu_rhadamanthys,SHIP,"The Rhadamanthys-class carrier fields a smaller complement of fighters than most vessels of its class, but compensates with a highly specialized flight deck and support systems that push its wings beyond standard performance.

The miniaturized design incorporates experimental features barely off the drawing board before the Collapse—only recently recovered and refined from datamined archives. Though often dismissed by proponents favoring massed carrier strikes, a Rhadamanthys’ fighters remain a nightmarish encounter for pilots.",,,,
ofu_hector,SHIP,"The Hector-class Battlecruiser is a design that combines decent mobility with a truly extraordinary amount of firepower. While only posessing mediocre defenses, the Hector's firepower dissuades all but the heaviest Capital ships from engaging it head on.

The development and at-scale construction of an entirely new class of Capital ship is considered the pinnacle of the engineering efforts of the Union shipyards, as well as one of the biggest industrial achievements postdatiing the Collapse. Due to defeats suffered at the hands of the Pirate Warlord Loke, the Development of the Hector-class was begun as a vital matter for the protection of the Union's worlds, as the previous arrangement of purchasing Capital ships from elsewhere, due to lack of blueprints and infrastructre, was now considerd to be unworkable.",,,,
ofu_aga_builtin,WEAPON,"The Gletscher Artillery is capable of efficient kinetic suppresion at extreme range. Good against shields.

The firing process that the Gletscher Artillery uses to achieve it's unusual range magnetizes the ferrous metal components of it's shells, leasing to some EM disruption when hitting solid objects",,,,
ofu_hesniper,WEAPON,"A long range, accurate, powerful but flux heavy high explosive cannon. Devestating against armor.

The Krater Cannon matches the firerate of some of the heaviest guns in the sector but enables frigates to crack the armor of destroyers and allows the secondary batteries of heavier ships to strip even capital grade armor",,,,
ofu_rocketke_pod,WEAPON,"A pod of fast, unguided rockets. Disrupts shield emitters and provides a serviceable EM payload upon hull contact.

Each rocket houses an iodized monocrystalline core within a reinforced sabot, engineered to strain energy dispersion systems on impact. Though the projectile burns out on contact like any conventional round, its forced interaction with active shielding places stress on enemy flux capacitors.",,,,
ofu_rocketke_launcher,WEAPON,"A launcher for fast, unguided rockets. Disrupts shield emitters and provides a serviceable EM payload upon hull contact.

Each rocket houses an iodized monocrystalline core within a reinforced sabot, engineered to strain energy dispersion systems on impact. Though the projectile burns out on contact like any conventional round, its forced interaction with active shielding places stress on enemy flux capacitors.",,,,
ofu_fragmg,WEAPON,"A Fast-Firing short range cannon with devestating effect against fighters

The Shells of the Lindwurm MG carry flechette warheads that are highly effective against the cramped systems of a fighter, but fall short against the heavier construction of actual spaceships",,,,
ofu_energytorpedo,WEAPON,"An advanced, remote-guided torpedo. Its payload features a compressed energy discharge in place of standard AM or chemical charges, offering reliable performance against both shields and armor.

The Donner’s detonation closely resembles the discharge of pulse laser weaponry common in the sector. The design was inspired by field reports of catastrophic EMP feedback caused by pulse laser capacitor failure under sustained overfire. The resulting effect was deemed ideal for torpedo adaptation, offering a reliable way to replicate system disruption alongside respectable damage capabilities.",,,,
ofu_fighterrocket,WEAPON,"An unguided proximity-fused rocket. Effective against fighters.

A very simple design with a mundane high explosive charge propelling metal fragments. Its simple design makes it very easy for fighters to carry.",,,,
ofu_superinterceptor,SHIP,"Fast, deadly and resilient, the Fräse interceptor is the choice for any task that demands fighter superiority. However, it's capabilities lead to an extremely demanding logistical profile.",,,,
ofu_fastbomber,SHIP,"The Zange Bomber is fast and versatile, trading strike power for accuracy and cycle time. It's Donner Torpedos are effetive against both armor and shields, enabling more strike vectors that remain effecitve.",,,,
ofu_rocketftr,SHIP,"A fast fighter, carrying decent firepower in the form of machine guns as well as a single volley of Schnuppe rockets, to be fired in the opening of a fighter to fighter engagement",,,,
